#  CI with GUI testing

On CloudBees your builds come with browsers built in - this shows you how to use Chrome - with phantom.js. 
Firefox is also available.

A simple sample app is started and tested in a headless chrome browser, and the test results presented. 

Press the big button to set this up in your account as a starting point:

When you run this clickstart, it will do the following:
* Create the Jenkins job
* Clone this project into a private git repo
* Set up the triggers.
* Run the build. Checkout the build test results it produces when it runs.

`build-ci` contains the build script.

Once you have run this clickstart - you can delete the "webapp" - and replace it with your own if you want to test. 

You can also look at other tools to do browser testing:

 * webdriver works just fine (http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/)
 * Saucelabs provided browsers also work (here is a clickstart showing that: https://github.com/CloudBees-community/sauce-java-clickstart)
 * Read more about browser based GUI testing: http://developer.cloudbees.com/bin/view/DEV/Testing+GUI+applications

CloudBees is a complete platform as a service - all your bits are hosted (even your source code and building).
